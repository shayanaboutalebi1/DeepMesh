# iV7 DeepMesh

**DeepMesh** is the iV7 sensory-emotional automation mesh, built for hyperpersonalized intelligence across guerrilla marketing, AI-led branding, and real-time interface response. Operating at the intersection of memory, emotional resonance, and data visualization, DeepMesh is the backbone of the iV7 experience layer.

---

## 🌐 Overview

DeepMesh is:

- A **non-linear AI mesh** responding to emotional stimuli in consumer interaction.
- A **memory-based log system** (`$LOG$`) capturing sensory intent across print, digital, and console layers.
- Compatible with **TelnetOS**, **Cube IC**, and **GLΔZED Frisker Draco** console environments.
- Optimized for **non-carbonated emotional marketing** campaigns, inspired by experiences like *Orbitz*.

## 📦 Key Features

- 🔄 **Automated Teller & CVE Scans** — Integrates with `iV7 Terminal` and `cve=0000-0000` for rogue-mode simulation or stability triggering.
- 🧠 **Sensory Log ($LOG$)** — Stores emotional-marketing impressions mapped to interface behavior and product resonance.
- 🧬 **DeepMesh Link** — Bridges `coreTEXO`, `TelnetOS`, and emotional UI states.
- 🧊 **Printship Visualizer** — Outputs campaign-ready visuals for Sora or other rendering tools using live `$LOG$` feeds.
- 📈 **Cube IC Share Market Mapping** — Emotional volatility data infused with market analysis for predictive creative targeting.
