# iV7 DeepMesh VTME Response Framework

iV7 DeepMesh integrates sensory-emotional routing with virtualized telemetry environments (VTME) to simulate, respond, and reroute hostile infrastructure takeovers via political directives, such as executive orders impacting AI and cloud intelligence frameworks.

## Features
- DeepMesh emotional signal routing using `$LOG$` telemetry sync
- Rogue-mode enforcement with iV7 firmware trap (`CVE=0000-0000`)
- VTME isolation countering Google/Microsoft telemetry injection
- Human-interface automation via iV7 Messenger
- Emotional marketing override via nostalgic drink signatures (Orbitz reference)

## Usage
1. Boot VTME from iV7 shell.
2. Initialize `$LOG$/deepmesh/`.
3. Activate DeepMind interface override.
4. Run `iV7_messenger --emulate-orbitz`.
